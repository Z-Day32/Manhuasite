**Chapter 3: Shadows in Grey Hollow**

The village of Grey Hollow was nothing like Kael had imagined. Nestled between sprawling hills and veiled in a constant mist, the settlement felt more like a graveyard than a bustling trade hub. Crumbling buildings leaned against each other like weary travelers, their stone facades worn and cracked by years of neglect. The streets were narrow and winding, shadowed by sagging rooftops. Even in daylight, the village seemed to swallow light whole, leaving only gloom in its wake.

Kael pulled his hood lower as he entered the village square. The weight of two swords on his back drew wary glances from passersby. Grey Hollow wasn’t a place that welcomed outsiders, and his presence was as conspicuous as a torch in a mine. Merchants hawked their wares from rickety stalls, their voices sharp and impatient, while beggars clung to the edges of the streets, their hollow eyes following every step Kael took.

“Keep moving,” Kael muttered to himself. He needed to find Varyn, the merchant Arlen had mentioned—a man who traded in secrets. But in a place like this, trust was worth less than the dirtiest coin.

Kael found Varyn in the shadow of a decrepit inn, sitting on a stool surrounded by mismatched goods. The man looked as disheveled as his wares—short, wiry, with a thin beard and eyes that darted around like a rat searching for food.

“You buying or just staring?” Varyn snapped, his voice as sharp as the rusty dagger on his belt.

Kael stepped closer, keeping his tone low. “I’m looking for information.”

“Information costs extra.” Varyn’s gaze flicked to Kael’s swords, and his lip curled. “You don’t look like you’ve got much to offer, swordsman.”

Kael pulled a coin pouch from his belt and tossed it onto the table. The jingle of gold made Varyn’s eyes light up. “I’m looking for answers about Ironpeak,” Kael said. “About the Black Legion. And a traitor in the Silver Blades.”

The mention of the Black Legion seemed to drain the color from Varyn’s face. He glanced around nervously before leaning in. “Keep your voice down. You’re asking dangerous questions, boy.”

“Do you have the answers or not?” Kael pressed.

Varyn hesitated, his fingers tapping the edge of the table. Finally, he sighed and nodded toward a nearby alley. “Not here. Meet me in the back. Ten minutes.”

Kael gave a short nod and stepped away, his instincts prickling. He didn’t trust Varyn—but then again, trust had become a luxury he couldn’t afford.

The alley was narrow, lined with rotting barrels and scraps of refuse. A chill settled in the air as Kael waited, his hand resting lightly on the hilt of his sword. Every sound seemed amplified—the creak of a shutter, the scurry of rats, the distant laughter from the inn.

Minutes passed before Varyn appeared, slipping into the alley with quick, nervous movements. “Listen carefully, swordsman,” he whispered, his voice barely audible. “The Black Legion didn’t just happen upon Ironpeak. They knew the Order’s defenses, its weaknesses… everything.”

Kael’s jaw tightened. “Who told them?”

Varyn swallowed hard, beads of sweat forming on his brow. “I don’t know names. But someone high up—someone in the Order. A messenger came through here weeks ago, carrying letters sealed with the Order’s crest. I didn’t see what was inside, but they paid handsomely to keep quiet.”

Kael’s fists clenched. A messenger… someone within the Order feeding secrets to the Legion. “Where did this messenger go?”

Varyn opened his mouth to reply, but his words turned into a choked gasp. A black arrow protruded from his chest, blood soaking his tunic. His eyes widened in shock as he collapsed to the ground, unmoving.

Kael spun around, his swords already drawn. The alley was empty, but the shadows seemed to ripple with movement. Above, on the rooftops, figures cloaked in black appeared, their bows trained on him. Black Legion assassins.

“So they’re here already,” Kael muttered. He raised his swords, the weight of Elandir’s blade balanced perfectly in his left hand. “Fine. Come, then.”

The assassins moved as one, arrows flying through the air. Kael was already in motion, twisting and deflecting the projectiles with his blades. His movements were fluid and deadly, honed by years of training under the Silver Blades. As the first assassin leapt from the rooftop, Kael met him mid-air, slashing his sword through the man’s chest before landing gracefully on the cobblestones.

Two more came at him, blades flashing in the dim light. Kael parried the first strike and countered with a brutal cut, his sword slicing through armor and bone. He ducked low, dodging the second assassin’s blade, and drove his other sword upward, impaling the attacker through the heart.

The alley was silent again, save for the dripping of blood and Kael’s ragged breathing. He wiped his blades clean and looked toward the rooftops, but the remaining assassins had disappeared into the mist. Cowards.

Kael knelt beside Varyn’s body, his mind racing. The traitor was real. And now the Black Legion knew he was looking for them.

He stood, sheathing his swords and pulling his hood back up. Grey Hollow had become a trap, and staying any longer would only invite more trouble. He needed to move. If someone in the Order had betrayed them, there was only one place left to go—the capital, Arkaen Hold.

But he wouldn’t go alone.

Lyra was waiting for him at the edge of the village, her cloak drawn tight around her. She raised an eyebrow as Kael approached, blood staining his sleeves.

“That didn’t take long,” she said dryly.

“We have a lead,” Kael replied. “The traitor’s trail leads to Arkaen Hold.”

Lyra’s expression darkened. “Then we’d best move quickly. If the Legion knows, they’ll try to cut us off.”

Kael nodded, his amber eyes burning with determination. “Let them try.”

Together, they vanished into the mist, the shadows of Grey Hollow closing in behind them. The road to Arkaen Hold would be long, and the enemies ahead many. But Kael’s resolve had never been stronger. He would find the traitor. He would see justice done.

And the Black Legion would know the wrath of the lone swordmaster.
