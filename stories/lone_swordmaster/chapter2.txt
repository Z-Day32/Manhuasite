**Chapter 2: Embers of Resolve**

Kael woke to the smell of metal and the sound of a distant hammer striking an anvil. The small room Arlen had lent him was sparse, its walls blackened with soot from years of the blacksmith’s work. A single flickering candle lit the space, casting long shadows on the rough-hewn wooden walls.

For the first time in days, Kael allowed himself to rest. But his sleep had been restless, plagued by visions of fire and steel. He could still hear the cries of his fallen brothers and sisters, still feel the tremor of Ironpeak collapsing beneath the weight of betrayal.

He swung his legs over the edge of the cot, his boots thudding softly against the floor. His swords leaned against the wall within reach, their polished surfaces reflecting the faint candlelight. Elandir’s blade, heavier and more ornate than his own, seemed to emanate a quiet weight of expectation. Kael sighed and strapped the swords to his back, the familiar weight grounding him as he made his way to Arlen’s forge.

The blacksmith was already at work, his hammer ringing out in rhythmic strikes. Sparks flew as he worked on a curved dagger, the orange glow of the forge casting him in stark relief. Arlen barely glanced up as Kael approached.

“You look like you’ve seen a ghost,” Arlen said gruffly, wiping sweat from his brow.

Kael leaned against the doorway, his eyes narrowing. “Not a ghost. Just the past.”

Arlen stopped hammering and looked at him fully. “What’s next, boy? You can’t stay here forever. The Legion won’t stop until they’ve turned everything to ash.”

Kael’s jaw tightened. “I know. But I need answers first. Someone betrayed us, Arlen. Someone from the Order. If I go after the Legion without knowing who, I’ll be fighting blind.”

The blacksmith’s face darkened. “And if you find this traitor? What then?”

Kael didn’t hesitate. “They’ll answer for their crimes.”

Arlen sighed, setting the half-finished dagger aside. He rummaged through a chest near the forge, pulling out a folded map. “If you’re looking for answers, you won’t find them here. But there’s a man in Grey Hollow—a merchant named Varyn. He deals in secrets as much as goods. If anyone knows about a betrayal in the Order, it’ll be him.”

Kael took the map, studying the path marked to Grey Hollow. “Thank you, Arlen. For everything.”

The blacksmith grunted. “Don’t thank me yet. You’ll need more than swords where you’re going.” He reached into the chest again, this time pulling out a small metal object. He tossed it to Kael, who caught it easily. It was a pendant, engraved with the symbol of the Silver Blades.

“What’s this?” Kael asked, running his thumb over the intricate design.

“A reminder,” Arlen said, his voice softer. “Of who you are. And who you’re fighting for.”

The road to Grey Hollow was long and treacherous. The trail wound through dense forests and across rocky terrain, with no sign of civilization for miles. Kael kept to the shadows, his senses on high alert. He’d learned the hard way that even the quietest roads could hide danger.

As night fell, he made camp beneath a cluster of trees. The fire he built was small but warm, its light flickering against the encroaching darkness. He ate sparingly from the rations Arlen had provided, his mind racing with thoughts of what awaited him in Grey Hollow.

The sound of snapping twigs jolted him from his thoughts. Kael’s hand flew to the hilt of his sword as he scanned the surrounding trees. The fire cast shifting shadows, but nothing moved.

“Show yourself,” Kael called, his voice steady despite the tension in his chest.

A figure stepped into the firelight, their features obscured by a hooded cloak. The glint of steel at their side told Kael they were armed, but the figure made no move to draw their weapon.

“You’re a hard man to track, Kael Ardent,” the stranger said, their voice low and gravelly.

Kael didn’t relax. “Who are you?”

The stranger lowered their hood, revealing a woman with sharp features and piercing green eyes. A scar ran down the side of her face, disappearing beneath the collar of her cloak.

“My name is Lyra,” she said. “I’m here to help.”

Kael’s grip on his sword didn’t loosen. “Help me with what?”

Lyra stepped closer, her gaze unwavering. “With finding the traitor. And with killing Malgrin.”

In the depths of the Black Legion’s camp, Malgrin the Shadowed sat in council with his commanders. The warlord’s armored fingers drummed against the table as he listened to the latest reports.

“The boy has left Ironpeak,” one of the commanders said, his voice laced with contempt. “He’s heading toward Grey Hollow.”

Malgrin’s lips curled into a cruel smile. “Good. Let him gather his allies. Let him think he has a chance.”

“Should we send scouts to intercept him?” another commander asked.

The warlord shook his head. “No. Let him come. He’ll bring the fight to us soon enough. And when he does, we’ll show him the true power of the Legion.”

His laughter echoed through the tent, a dark promise of the battles to come.
